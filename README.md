Elisabeth Le Leslé's GitHub:

Hello! I'm currently a final year student at École Polytechnique's Bachelor, double majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. 
I'm very curious about Artificial Intelligence and its applications to various fields
but also love learning about Cloud Computing and Quantum Computing. 

These are just some of the projects I worked on, but if you wish to discuss about them some more, contact me on:
